                    Finally, after much angry discussion, it was decided: the bird that could fly higher would be the queen. And since there were not enough birds that agreed with any other plan, the competition began.

                    All at once the birds rose to the sky. They flapped their wings, leapt, leapt, and crawled into the air like a roof of wings rising …

                    The struggling birds of great chatter, the restless finches and sparrows, the slow fluttering of gulls and oceanic birds, the invisible fluttering of hummingbirds, all soared higher … higher and higher, a column of birds circling the sky.
                    But above all of them came the patient eagle fluttering among rags of cloud.

                    But above all of them came the patient eagle fluttering among rags of cloud. <br><br> 

                    “The eagle must be the queen,” said one smaller bird to another. And so a murmur spread through the crowd.

                    But when the eagle could no longer fly higher … A wren came out of its hiding place between the feathers of the eagle’s back and, furiously flapping its wings, rose into the cold, thin air … higher than the eagle, more higher than all other birds.

                    And so it was decided!

                    The wren and eagle nearly dropped to the ground where the wren hid in a thorny hedge, safe from the eagle’s furious gaze.

                    And so the wren became Queen of the birds. Because, as the older (and certainly the wisest) birds agreed, it was good to have the highest flying bird as Queen, but it was even better to have the smartest bird as Queen.

                    Columbidae (/kəˈlʌmbɪdiː/) is a bird family consisting of pigeons and doves. It is the only family in the order Columbiformes. These are stout-bodied birds with short necks, and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres. They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. The family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms.

                    The family contains 344 species divided into 50 genera. Thirteen of the species are extinct.[2] <br> <br>

                    In English, the smaller species tend to be called "doves" and the larger ones "pigeons".[3] However, the distinction is not consistent,[3] and does not exist in most other languages. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms. The bird most commonly referred to as just "pigeon" is the domestic pigeon, which is common in many cities as the feral pigeon.

                    Pigeon is a French word that derives from the Latin pipio, for a "peeping" chick,[4] while dove is an ultimately Germanic word that refers to the bird's diving flight.[5] The English dialectal word culver appears to derive from Latin columba.[4] A group of doves is called a "dule", taken from the French word deuil ('mourning').[6] <br> <br>

                    Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests, often using sticks and other debris, which may be placed on branches of trees, on ledges, or on the ground, depending on species. They lay one or (usually) two white eggs at a time, and both parents care for the young, which leave the nest after 25–32 days. Unfledged baby doves and pigeons are called squabs and are generally able to fly by 5 weeks of age. These fledglings, with their immature squeaking voices, are called squeakers once they are weaned or weaning.[7] Unlike most birds, both sexes of doves and pigeons produce "crop milk" to feed to their young, secreted by a sloughing of fluid-filled cells from the lining of the crop.

                    Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and comprise the biological family Trochilidae. With about 360 species, they occur from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, but the vast majority of the species are found in the tropics. They are small birds, with most species measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. The smallest extant hummingbird species is the 5 cm (2.0 in) bee hummingbird, which weighs less than 2.0 g (0.07 oz). The largest hummingbird species is the 23 cm (9.1 in) giant hummingbird, weighing 18–24 grams (0.63–0.85 oz). They are specialized for feeding on flower nectar, but all species consume flying insects or spiders. <br> <br>

They are specialized for feeding on flower nectar, but all species consume flying insects or spiders. <br> <br>

                    Hummingbirds split from their sister group, the swifts and treeswifts, around 42 million years ago (Mya). The common ancestor of extant hummingbirds is estimated to have lived 22 Mya in South America. They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans. They hover in midair at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species to around 80 per second in small hummingbirds. Of those species that have been measured during flying in wind tunnels, their top speeds exceed 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph). During courtship, some male species dive from 30 metres (100 ft) of height above a female at speeds around 23 m/s (83 km/h; 51 mph).[1][2]

                    Hummingbirds have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any homeothermic animal.[3] To conserve energy when food is scarce and nightly when not foraging, they can go into torpor, a state similar to hibernation, and slow their metabolic rate to 1/15 of its normal rate.[4]
